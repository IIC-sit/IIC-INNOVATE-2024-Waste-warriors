  Client Reporting:
•	Clients need a user-friendly interface to input the location of dirty or waste-filled areas.
•	The system should capture specific details such as the type of waste (e.g., garbage, litter, hazardous material), severity of the mess, and location details.
  Location Verification:
•	The system should validate the reported location to ensure it is an accurate, real-world address or GPS coordinates.
•	The application should integrate with mapping and GPS services to allow easy submission and real-time location identification

The goal of this hackathon is to foster creativity, teamwork, and innovation among participants. We will work on solving challenges related to **[specific domain or technology]**, with the objective of **[specific problem you are addressing]**.
